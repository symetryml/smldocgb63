# The SymetryML Difference

SymetryML is an application that allows organizations to leverage their existing data to gain further insight into their current business processes. Whether you want to increase user clicks, select the most appropriate product, or analyze the relationship between various factors affecting your business, SymetryML can offer you a real-time, scalable, and easy-to-deploy platform on which to build the next generation of data-driven applications within your organization.

A unique feature of SymetryML is the adoption of the **online learning** approach to predictive analytics. This is accomplished by separating the learning phase from model creation. By avoiding the complete data scan typically required by the majority of other systems, users are able to experiment with many different models, using a varying selection of attributes, and find the perfect combination of attributes for their particular task. Separating learning and modeling also allows SymetryML to account for new attributes dynamically, including increments and decrements. Adding new attributes is simply a matter of feeding new data into SymetryML. If at some stage the data is found to be erroneous, removing these records from SymetryML becomes a simple operation. Experimenting with large datasets becomes a much more fluid and less time-consuming process, thus enabling faster deployments and a quicker time-to-market.
