# ML Toolkit

This user guide is intended for analysts using SymetryML in their next data-mining project. While this document does not assume extensive background in data modeling, the reader should have a rudimentary understanding of data-mining methodology, as well as the necessary domain knowledge related to their field of application.

A brief introduction to data-mining concepts will be provided in this guide, along with instructions on applying these concepts to SymetryML workflow. The core intention of this document is to provide readers with a brief summary of the information needed to implement SymetryML successfully into their data-driven projects and to cover typical usage scenarios.
